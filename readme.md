### Abstract

Considering the privatization of space within urban landscapes and growing disparities in equity, libraries have incredible potential to shed light on community needs and the power of public space . This paper investigates the ways in which library services and uses vary across space and the ways in which they map onto the diverse socioeconomic & demographic characteristics of the neighborhoods that they serve. To answer this question, I map socio-demographic variables from the 2021 American Community Survey onto library service areas generated using Thiessen polygons and population weighted reaggregation. I surveyed the Chicago Public Library profiles to collect library service data which was then analyzed alongside the socio-demographic variables. The study revealed that library service areas display significant socio-economic and demographic variability that reflect Chicagoâ€™s racial and economic segregation. Additionally, socio-economic and demographic characteristics shape the services and programming available at local libraries. Affluent and predominantly white areas showed higher rates of circulation and availability of mental health services while neighborhoods that were predominantly poor, Black and/or Latinx Socio-economic and demographic characteristics significantly shape the services, programming, and amenities at Chicago libraries, with affluent and predominantly white areas receiving higher circulation and specialized services, while disadvantaged, predominantly Black and Latinx areas rely more on non-traditional services like internet access and social support.
